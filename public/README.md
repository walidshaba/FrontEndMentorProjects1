## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Position properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I really learnt the differences between media queries

`@media screen and (max-width:### and  min-width:###`

### Continued development

I think this would be the end and final end of this project for me no more developments

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This site helped me in setting box-shadowing and some media queries doubt i was having.
